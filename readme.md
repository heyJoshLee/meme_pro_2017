# Meme Pro 2017

A ruby script to generate branded social media images and post them to facebook.

## How to Use

- A 'config.yaml' with the key FACEBOOK_TOKEN is required to post to Facebook.
- Add raw images to the 'images' folder and run the program.

## How it Works

This script takes the images from the 'images' folder and creates an HTML file with branded styling. The script then converts that HTML file into an image file. This allows a user to create programmatically generated images with the brand's colors and other branding.
